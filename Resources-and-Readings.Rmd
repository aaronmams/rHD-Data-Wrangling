Here is a list of resources that I have curated on the topics of vectorization, data manipulation with dplyr and the tidyverse, and a few other assorted gems.

## Vectorization

1. [This is a great open resource from Alyssa Frazee](http://alyssafrazee.com/2014/01/29/vectorization.html) on "vectorization"

2. [The Software Carpentry folks also have a cool lesson on "vectorization"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/09-vectorization/)

## ```apply```

1. [Nice Primer on Apply](https://ademos.people.uic.edu/Chapter4.html)

## ```dplyr```

1. [dplyr and "the grammar" of data manipulation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)

2. [A dplyr discussion from UBC's STAT 545 class](https://stat545.com/dplyr-intro.html). Side note: If you really want to geek-out on R-stuff you should definitely follow [Jenny Bryan on the Twitter](https://twitter.com/jennybryan?lang=en).

## The Tidyverse

[Hadley Wickham's Primer on Tidyr](https://blog.rstudio.com/2014/07/22/introducing-tidyr/)

[The Tidyverse Cheat Sheet](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)

## data.table
